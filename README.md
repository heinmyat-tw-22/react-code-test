# React Code Test


## Requirements:

-   Use React to build a small web application that fetches and displays data from an external API
-   Implement client-side routing using React Router
-   Use Git for version control

## Functionality:

The application should have the following functionality:

-   The application should fetch data from the [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).
-   The application should display a list of posts, with each post showing its title and body.
-   Clicking on a post should take the user to a page showing the full post details, including the post's comments.
-   The application should have a search bar that allows the user to search for posts by title. The search should update the displayed list of posts in real-time as the user types.

## Technical Requirements:

-   Use `create-react-app`  with **Typescript** template to bootstrap the application.
-   Use functional components with hooks for state management.
-   Use React Router for client-side routing.
-   Use Git for version control and commit frequently with clear commit messages.
-   Use asynchronous data fetching with `fetch` or `axios`.
-   Use Typescript for type-checking the component props.
-   Use ES6 syntax and features throughout the application.

## Bonus Points:

-   Use Redux or any other state management library to manage the application state.
- Use React 18 latest features to optimize and smoother UX.
- Use `React Query` for API handling.
-   Write unit tests for the components using Jest and React Testing Library.
-  Use a CSS preprocessor (e.g. SASS, LESS) to style the application

## Submission:

-   Create a GitHub repository for the project and push all the code to it.
-   Include a README file that explains how to run the application.
-   Send the link to your GitHub repository to the interviewer for review.

Good luck!
